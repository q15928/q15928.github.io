Another certification achieved this year!

When I was using Databricks a couple years ago, Delta Lake was on early stage at that time. We mainly used it for ETL, along with ADF for orchestrating and SQL Data Warehouse (now Azure Synapse). It was great to see a lot of new capabilities and features emerging in Databricks. The Lakehouse platform unifies the advantages of both data lake and data warehouse based on Delta Lake which provides ACID transactional reliability and performance. Features such as Medallion architecture, Auto Loader, Delta Live Tables, and Databricks SQL make the daily life of data engineers / data analysts much easier.

Thanks to the fantastic training from @bo zhang, I have brushed up my previous skills and exposed to the new knowledge. It also definitely helped me to pass the certification exam!
