I can't go to Shanghai due to COVID. However my friend managed to take my models to participate in the physical deepracer event.

We went through the preparation process of loading the model, calibration, and speed testing. We made it as the second place in the physical track racing!

Additionally, during the show time, we boosted the car to achieve the best time of the event. Then we won two rounds of car chase, even beating the champion!
