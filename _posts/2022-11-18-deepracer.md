On your marks, get set, go!!!

Due to busy work, I decided to take the race all by myself as a solo team. I can only afford about 6 hours to train a couple models. I am really proud I made it to the final as the 12th in qualification.

Even more surprisingly, the model was performing extremely well in the physical track. I was only 0.6 second behind the 1st place.

Here is the snapshots of the four models which I trained for this race.
