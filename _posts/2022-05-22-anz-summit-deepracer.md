Yet another race. 
<!--more-->
I was excited to be qualified through to the finals of the AWS Summit ANZ 2022 DeepRacer event which was held in ICC Sydney. It was the first time for me to compete and learn from some of the best racers in Australia. 

I used the same model for the qualifier and the final which I only trained for two hours over a weekend. Unfortunately I couldn't make it for the in-person racing. I just watched the remote streaming during the event. It was interesting to find out how big the difference between physical track and virtual track. The top performers in the qualifier didn't really do well in the final. I am glad that my model was well-balanced in both environments which was ended up fourth place in the final.
