I have switched to Google photos, there is no need to use flickr anymore.
<!--more-->
I was using flickr to store photos I had taken when I travelled around in my 20's and early 30's. It was great to visit so many amazing places, to meet different kinds of people, and to foster some long-lasting friendships.

Thanks flickr to bring me those good old memories. Going through those photos, it is just like yesterday once more... How time flies!
