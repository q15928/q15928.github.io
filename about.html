I am a data engineer who have worked on various data and machine learning projects on AWS, Microsoft Azure, and on-prem Cloudera clusters which had been well recognised.

I am fond of Traditional Chinese Medicine. I appreciate the theory of the rhythm of the human body following the natural changes and the inner "chi" being able to go through different paths which is the reason acupuncture takes effect. Hopefully one day I will like Paul (in <i>Kung Fu Panda</i>) to find the "inner peace".
