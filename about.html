I am a Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer. I have worked on various data projects on AWS, Microsoft Azure, and on-prem Hadoop clusters which had been well recognised.
<br><br>
I have earned Master of Data Science from the University of Sydney. I have also completed a Deep Learning Specialisation by Professor Andrew Ng on Coursera.

I am fond of Traditional Chinese Medicine. I appreciate the theory of the rhythm of the human body following the natural changes and the inner "chi" being able to go through different paths which is the reason acupuncture takes effect. Hopefully one day I will like Paul (in <i>Kung Fu Panda</i>) to find the "inner peace".
